# phe [![build status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/thlorenz/phe.png)](http://travis-ci.org/thlorenz/phe)

Poker hand evaluator, a port of [PokerHandEvaluator](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator).

It's super fast even though still 3x slower than the C version it was ported from, but hey you can use this directly
with Node.js or even in the browser.

It's fast, cause it's using a hash algorithm relying on masking and tables. However the table data isn't huge like I've
seen in other projects. This is possible because flushes are considered separately from other rankings

I highly recommend reading the [informative writeup on how this all
works](https://github.com/HenryRLee/PokerHandEvaluator/tree/master/Documentation).

```js
const { rankBoard, rankDescription } = require('phe')

const board = 'As Ks 4h Ad Kd'
const rank = rankBoard(board)
const name = rankDescription[rank]

console.log('%s is a %s', board, name)
```

    As Ks 4h Ad Kd is a Two Pair

## Installation

    npm install phe
